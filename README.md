# Remindit

*Remind it!* is an Android application created by Albert Suarez Molgo, an student at *BarcelonaTech*, Polytechnic University of Catalonia. This application was developed in a project of a subject of the faculty: *Interaction and Interface Design*. Remind it was my first Android application, so very probably it lacks basic functionality and better design and implementation. I accept reviews, for I can improve my application.

This application is a *Calendar Application* that it allows to create meetings and task to do it. Remind it has a help where it explains all the functionalities, for example:

- How can I add a meeting?
- How can I add a task?
- How can I mark a task as done?
- How can I change week?
- How can I view events on a particular day?
- How can I delete specific event?
- How can I delete all events?

Next, you can see few *screenshots* of Remind it:

The tasks have the feature is being able undertaken or not. In its creation, as is logical, are marked as done (and thus relates graphically with the color red).

Once there you can simply click on a task list and this will emerge a popup window where you ask if you really want to mark it as done. Once accepted the job action will disappear from the list and will be represented by the color green.

To view other days users have two options.

The first and simplest is only made to slide the screen to the left and to the right in order to access the next and previous week.

If you wanted to access a particular calendar week, should press the button with the symbol of a magnifying glass and a list of the top menu and bring about the emergence of a popup that allow the user to mark a specific date and be able to go to the week containing that day marked.

Aside from the Week view, the user also has the ability to view events on a particular day.

In order to do so, it is as simple as clicking on the number of leaves on the head of the calendar. Once done, the user is redirected to a screen where you will be solely and exclusively meetings and tasks today.

You only need to select the symbol with three small squares in the top menu and you'll see a drop; there you will find the option to Delete All Data.

Once depressed this option, a window appears where you really want to make sure to delete all events from the database.\n\nOnce you have clicked on OK, all events must be eliminated.
