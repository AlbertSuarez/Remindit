# Remindit

*Remind it!* is an Android application created by Albert Suarez Molgo, an student at BarcelonaTech, Polytechnic University of Catalonia. This application was developed in a project of a subject of the faculty: Interaction and Interface Design. Remind it was my first Android application, so very probably it lacks basic functionality and better design and implementation. I accept reviews, for I can improve my application.

This application is a **Calendar Application** that it allows to create meetings and task to do it. Remind it has a help where it explains all the functionalities, for example:

- How can I add a meeting?
- How can I add a task?
- How can I mark a task as done?
- How can I change week?
- How can I view events on a particular day?
- How can I delete specific event?
- How can I delete all events?

Next, you can see few screenshots of Remind it:
